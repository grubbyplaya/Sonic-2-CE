A currently unfinished port of the Sega Master System version of Sonic 2 to the TI-84+ CE.

So far, the game assembles into a 36KB .8xp file, but launching it will crash your calculator. 

# Controls

Arrow keys - Move Sonic

2nd/Alpha - Jump

# To Do

Port VDP routines to the TI-84+ CE (sprite and palette routines are done)

Make an equates file for all of the labels in the appvars folder (~20% done)

(NOT NEEDED) Expand the original game's 256x192 resolution into the 84+ CE's 320x240 resolution
