All of the game data is stored in appvars to conserve space.

Additionally, this also helps further my secondary goal for Sonic 2 CE; turning 8-bit Sonic 2 into a custom engine that runs on the TI-84+ CE. 

To achieve this, every level in the game will need to be repackaged into .8xv appvars that can be edited and replaced with entirely new levels, like with Oiram.
